                        <h1>Rainbow lager (copper beer)</h1>
                        <p>The Rainbow lager is a classic student beer you can see these in every student event.
                        The name copper beer comes from the cans color which is copper like orange.
                        </p>
                        <p>The price of copper beer is around 0,99€ the price can be different depending of the
                        shop you buy it from, Prisma and S-markets are cheaper than Alepa. The taste is good but a 
                        bit watery so the rating we gave is 4.6/5!

                        <h1>Pirkka III-beer (Sausage water)</h1>
                        <p>Pirkka III-beer is also very easy to spot in student events because it's blue color.
                        We name the beer nakkivesi (sausage water) because of it's taste.
                        </p>
                        <p>Price of the Pirkka III-beer is around 1,15€ so it's the most expensive one of the cheap beers.
                        The taste is also not that great, but some times you are in a hurry and the clock is getting
                        close to 9 pm, so you get what ever you can get your hands on! We gave a rating of 2.8/5 because
                        it's taste is not that great and it's by far the most expensive one.
                        </p>
